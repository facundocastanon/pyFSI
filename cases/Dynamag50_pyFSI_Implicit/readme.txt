This model was developed to estimate the damping in a free fall to check if the modal damping coefficiet is ok. Then I used it to calculate how much the displacement is reduced if I plug a damping at a certain time and thus check if the bifurcation stops after extracting power from the device. And then to check the pressure center location.
